# Introduction to Long-Read Data Analysis

This page provides entry-level bioinformatic tutorials for Long-Read data
analysis with particular focus on Oxford Nanopore data. The material was
initially created for the Long-read, long-reach sequencing workshop held at
the Australian National University, 11-15th of November 2019 but has been
extended and will be updated for new courses or whenever I find the time.
